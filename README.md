# ChessAI
## Plan
**Classical engine**:
- [X] Create "decent" agent with alpha beta pruning and minimax
- [X] Implement Move ordering
- [X] Implement transpositions (caching)
- [ ] Implement Iterative deepening search
This classical engine is limited by the performance of the chess game implementation (heavily)

**Deep lerning agent**:
- [ ] Learned model, policy, and value network based on plays of DL agents

**Evaluation of agent strenght**:
Come up with a simple strength evaluator that can be used to measure progress for the DL agent and 
baseline for classical engine based agent
